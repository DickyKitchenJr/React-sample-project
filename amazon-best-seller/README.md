# Mock Amazon Best Seller Site

## Purpose:

- to recreate the Amazon books best seller site
- to demonstrate ability to use React to build the front end of a site

## Resources Used:

- React
- Visual Studio Code
- yarn
- original Amazon books best seller thriller and suspense site for reference (https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Books-Thrillers-Suspense/zgbs/books/10484/ref=zg_bs_nav_books_2_18)
- FontAwesome
- Corel PaintShop Pro (to fine tune Amazon logo and user icon)
- Netlify to simplify deployment

### Challenges along the way:

- icons used were changed to free versions largely found on FontAwesome as the original icons were either Amazon property or required payment to get access to them
- colors were set by eye comparison vs looking at the exact colors used on the Amazon site as I did not want to copy code from their source code, as a result colors may not match the Amazon site completely
